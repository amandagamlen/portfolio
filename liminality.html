            <p>Liminal spaces, characterized by their transitional and transformative nature, have become a prominent concept in anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, and art. The term "liminality" finds its roots in the Latin word "limēn," meaning "threshold" (Definition of LIMINALITY, 2023), and its conceptual development can be attributed to the works of anthropologists Arnold van Gennep (1960) and Victor Turner (1969).</p>
            <p>The concept of liminality was first introduced in the early 20th century by French anthropologist Arnold van Gennep. In his work "The Rites of Passage", Van Gennep (1960) explored how societies mark and manage the transitions that individuals undergo during critical life events. He identified three distinct phases within these rituals: separation, liminality, and incorporation. The liminal phase, as van Gennep defined it, represents the interim state between the individual's departure from one social status and their entry into a new one.</p>
<p>Building upon van Gennep's foundation, British anthropologist Victor Turner expanded scope of liminality beyond rites of passage and explored how liminal experiences challenge established social norms and structures. In his work "The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure", Turner (1969) introduced the term "anti-structure" to describe the temporary dissolution of hierarchical roles and the emergence of alternative social orders within liminal phases. He emphasized the dynamic interplay between structure and anti-structure, highlighting the potential for transformation and change within liminal spaces.</p>
            <p>Liminality's influence has since transcended anthropology into various disciplines, including: psychology, literature, philosophy, cultural studies and art. Psychologically, liminality is linked to moments of disorientation and personal growth, where individuals confront uncertainty and adapt to new circumstances. In literature, authors explore liminal spaces to convey characters' psychological journeys or societal transitions. Philosophers engage with liminality's existential aspects, pondering the transitional nature of existence and the spaces between conventional categories. Artworks that play with perception and challenge the viewer's understanding can also evoke a sense of liminality. Optical illusions, abstract art, and pieces that use unusual perspectives can create a feeling of being in-between states of perception.</p>
<p>In contemporary society, liminality has gained renewed relevance as people examine its applications in diverse contexts. As we contemplate life before the pandemic and how it will change moving forward, the concept assumes a metaphorical significance as a lens through which to view transitional experiences. Barren parking lots, deserted shopping centers, and empty train stations are frequent depictions of liminal spaces; places that were once inhabited but have since fallen into disrepair, underscoring the significance of uncertainty and discomfort as catalysts for personal and societal evolution. Urban spaces undergoing transformation, such as gentrification, can also be viewed as liminal spaces that challenge established social structures. </p><p>In the blurring of online and offline boundaries, digital spaces often evoke liminal qualities. The viral “Liminal Space Aesthetic” is closely tied to internet culture’s fascination with nostalgia, basing itself on an idealized vision of the past (Aesthetics Wiki, n.d.). The aesthetics ability to evoke feelings of uncertainty, nostalgia, and contemplation has led to its widespread adoption in various creative mediums and online spaces. In “Ghosts of My Life: Writings on Depression, Hauntology and Lost Futures”, English cultural critic Mark Fisher (2014) discusses the “slow cancellation of the future”, or the disappearance of culture; a concept which lends itself to the trend towards nostalgic motifs in popular culture. Fisher suggests that as society becomes dominated by neoliberal capitalism and a sense of stagnation, the promise of a better future becomes increasingly elusive. </p>
<p>Romanticized depictions of a hazy, nostalgic world of familiar imagery combined with childhood memories have inspired Subreddits, Instagram accounts, Pinterest boards and TikToks. In contrast to earlier times, when people looked to the future with enthusiasm and hope, it's difficult to envision a future worth anything but fear. Liminal spaces illuminate the dynamics of change and the inherent uncertainties of existence, so it’s unsurprising that these unsettling spaces are often filtered through a rose-tinted lens.</p>
